# List

List is my personal to-do list. 

It’s a single page UITableView application. 

- Add an item by tapping `+` in the top right. 
- Delete an item by tapping the cell. 
- For important items,  include an “!” in the item to change the text colour to red.

#### To-do’s (for this app)

- Add Edit feature. 
- Add ‘Swipe to complete’ feature. 
- Add undo delete button + shake to undo.
- Replace add item `UIAlertView’ with a more attractive ‘UIView’ Subclass.
